# counterpoint
Web application to automatically solve first species counterpoint problems in major



Counterpoint is a type of Music Theory problem, where a student is given 
a melodic line called a cantus firmus. Then, the student has to create another
line of music to make a two-voice phrase. The student's line must adhere to several 
intervallic and melodic rules. Thus, there are a set number of solutions. These rules 
formed the basis for western music, and the great classical composers were aware of 
them. This makes counterpoint a very useful practice for both beginning composing and
music analysis.

This project seeks to automatically generate all possible solutions to a given 
cantus firmus in a major key. It also provides playback.
