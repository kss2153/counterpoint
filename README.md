# counterpoint
Web application to automatically solve first species counterpoint problems in major



Counterpoint is a specific type of Music Theory problem, where a student is given 
a melodic line called a cantus firmus. Then, the student would have to create another
line of music to make a two-voice prase. The student's line must adhere to several 
intervallic and melodic rules; these rules formed the basis for western music, and 
the great classical composers were aware of them.

This project seeks to automatically generate all possible solutions to a given 
cantus firmus in a major key. It also provides playback.
